# Problem Framer

This skill guides the user to articulate a problem statement effectively using the Problem Framing Canvas.

## Workflow

1.  **Read Context**: Read the content of `skills/problem-framing.md` to understand the template.
2.  **Gather Information**: Ask the user for the following if not provided:
    *   Target Persona (Who)
    *   Desired Outcome (What they are trying to do)
    *   Barriers/Obstacles (But...)
    *   Root Cause (Because...)
    *   Emotions (Which makes me feel...)
3.  **Generate Statement**: Use the template in `skills/problem-framing.md` to generate a structured Problem Statement.
